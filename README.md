## The Saga
The Leaderboard acts as a place to give recognition to Hack Clubs that are doing amazing work in the Hack Club circle.

The Leaderboard is a real-time platform where hack clubs are given:
1. recognition for their work.
2. a digital profile to show amazing people and work happening at their hack club.
3. a platform to discover other amazing hack clubs in their region.
4. a complete slack environment to manage their club's presence on the leaderboard.

> There are points for different activities and the points of all Hack Clubs are reset to 0 after every month!

> Everything mentioned above is customizable via a bot ranker that we have integrated into Hack Club's Slack. 
> So Hack Clubs have full control over their club's page without the requirement of any middlemen.

## Club Wall

Each club page has a club wall, which contains images and videos from a club's events, meets, and other activities.
