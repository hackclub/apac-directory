## The Saga

The Directory acts as a place to explore Hack Clubs in the APAC region and explore the amazing work being done by them in the Hack Club circle.

The Directory is a real-time platform where hack clubs are given:

1. a digital profile to show amazing people and work happening at their hack club.
2. a platform to discover other amazing hack clubs in their region.
3. a platform to maintain stats for their Hack Club.
4. a complete slack environment to manage their club's presence on the Directory.

<br/>
These are the stats that are provided for every Hack Club's page of the Directory.

> Everything mentioned above is customizable via a bot [ranker](https://github.com/hackclub/ranker) that we have integrated into Hack Club's Slack.
> So Hack Clubs have full control over their club's page without the requirement of any middlemen.

## Club Wall

Each club page has a club wall, which contains images and videos from a club's events, meets, and other activities.
